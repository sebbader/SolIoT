# SOLIOT: SOLID for IoT

This repository contains the SOLIOT prototype implementation. It heavily relies on the SOLID NodeJS reference implementation (credits to the SOLID developer community!) and has been extended with CoAP and MQTT enspoints. The goal of this project is to use the advantages of the SOLID approach and introduce it into the IoT and Industry 4.0 community.

The SOLIOT server requires further configuration attributes (check (config.json)[config.json]) and will, after start, provide the respective endpoints at 5684 (CoAP) and 8883 (MQTT).

## Command Line Usage


### Run a single-user server (beginner)

The easiest way to setup `solid-server` is by running the wizard. This will create a `config.json` in your current folder

```bash
$ solid init
```
**Note**: If prompted for an SSL key and certificate, follow the instructions below.

To run your server, simply run `solid start`:

```bash
$ solid start
# Solid server (solid v0.2.24) running on https://localhost:8443/
```

If you prefer to use flags instead, the following would be the equivalent

```bash
$ solid start --port 8443 --ssl-key path/to/ssl-key.pem --ssl-cert path/to/ssl-cert.pem
# Solid server (solid v0.2.24) running on https://localhost:8443/
```

If you want to run `solid` on a particular folder (different from the one you are in, e.g. `path/to/folder`):

```bash
$ solid start --root path/to/folder --port 8443 --ssl-key path/to/ssl-key.pem --ssl-cert path/to/ssl-cert.pem
# Solid server (solid v0.2.24) running on https://localhost:8443/
```

### Running in development environments

Solid requires SSL certificates to be valid, so you cannot use self-signed certificates. To switch off this security feature in development environments, you can use the `bin/solid-test` executable, which unsets the `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED` flag and sets the `rejectUnauthorized` option.

If you want to run in multi-user mode on localhost, do the following:
* configure the server as such with `bin/solid-test init`
* start the server with `bin/solid-test start`
* visit https://localhost:8443 and register a user, for instance 'myusername'.
* Edit your hosts file and add a line `127.0.0.1 myusername.localhost`
* Now you can visit https://myusername.localhost:8443.

##### How do I get an SSL key and certificate?
You need an SSL certificate from a _certificate authority_, such as your domain provider or [Let's Encrypt!](https://letsencrypt.org/getting-started/).

For testing purposes, you can use `bin/solid-test` with a _self-signed_ certificate, generated as follows:

```
$ openssl req -outform PEM -keyform PEM -new -x509 -sha256 -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout ../privkey.pem -days 365 -out ../fullchain.pem

```

Note that this example creates the `fullchain.pem` and `privkey.pem` files
in a directory one level higher from the current, so that you don't
accidentally commit your certificates to `solid` while you're developing.

If you would like to get rid of the browser warnings, import your fullchain.pem certificate into your 'Trusted Root Certificate' store.

 ```

Instead of using flags, these same options can also be configured via environment variables taking the form of `SOLID_` followed by the `SNAKE_CASE` of the flag. For example `--api-apps` can be set via the `SOLID_API_APPS`environment variable, and `--serverUri` can be set with `SOLID_SERVER_URI`.

CLI flags take precedence over Environment variables, which take precedence over entries in the config file.

Configuring Solid via the config file can be a concise and convenient method and is the generally recommended approach. CLI flags can be useful when you would like to override a single configuration parameter, and using environment variables can be helpful in situations where you wish to deploy a single generic Docker image to multiple environments.

## Library Usage

### Install Dependencies

```
npm install
```

### Library Usage

The library provides two APIs:

- `solid.createServer(settings)`: starts a ready to use
    [Express](http://expressjs.com) app.
- `lnode(settings)`: creates an [Express](http://expressjs.com) that you can
    mount in your existing express app.

In case the `settings` is not passed, then it will start with the following
default settings.

```javascript
{
  cache:        0,           // Set cache time (in seconds), 0 for no cache
  live:         true,        // Enable live support through WebSockets
  root:         './',        // Root location on the filesystem to serve resources
  secret:       'node-ldp',  // Express Session secret key
  cert:         false,       // Path to the ssl cert
  key:          false,       // Path to the ssl key
  mount:        '/',         // Where to mount Linked Data Platform
  webid:        false,       // Enable WebID+TLS authentication
  suffixAcl:    '.acl',      // Suffix for acl files
  corsProxy:    false,       // Where to mount the CORS proxy
  errorHandler: false,       // function(err, req, res, next) to have a custom error handler
  errorPages:   false        // specify a path where the error pages are
}
```

Have a look at the following examples or in the
[`examples/`](https://github.com/solid/node-solid-server/tree/master/examples) folder
for more complex ones

##### Simple Example

You can create a `solid` server ready to use using `solid.createServer(opts)`

```javascript
var solid = require('solid-server')
var ldp = solid.createServer({
    key: '/path/to/sslKey.pem',
    cert: '/path/to/sslCert.pem',
    webid: true
})
ldp.listen(3000, function() {
  // Started Linked Data Platform
})
```

##### Advanced Example

You can integrate `solid` in your existing [Express](https://expressjs.org)
app, by mounting the `solid` app on a specific path using `lnode(opts)`.

```javascript
var solid = require('solid-server')
var app = require('express')()
app.use('/test', solid(yourSettings))
app.listen(3000, function() {
  // Started Express app with ldp on '/test'
})
...
```

##### Logging

Run your app with the `DEBUG` variable set:

```bash
$ DEBUG="solid:*" node app.js
```

## Testing `solid` Locally

#### Pre-Requisites

In order to really get a feel for the Solid platform, and to test out `solid`,
you will need the following:

1. A WebID profile and browser certificate from one of the Solid-compliant
    identity providers, such as [solid.community](https://solid.community).

2. A server-side SSL certificate for `solid` to use (see the section below
    on creating a self-signed certificate for testing).

While these steps are technically optional (since you could launch it in
HTTP/LDP-only mode), you will not be able to use any actual Solid features
without them.

#### Creating a certificate for local testing

When deploying `solid` in production, we recommend that you go the
usual Certificate Authority route to generate your SSL certificate (as you
would with any website that supports HTTPS). However, for testing it locally,
you can easily [generate a self-signed certificate for whatever domain you're
Working with](https://github.com/solid/node-solid-server#how-do-i-get-an-ssl-key-and-certificate).

#### Accessing your server

If you started your `solid` server locally on port 8443 as in the example
above, you would then be able to visit `https://localhost:8443` in the browser
(ignoring the Untrusted Connection browser warnings as usual), where your
`solid` server would redirect you to the default data viewer app.

#### Editing your local `/etc/hosts`

To test certificates and account creation on subdomains, `solid`'s test suite
uses the following localhost domains: `nic.localhost`, `tim.localhost`, and
`nicola.localhost`. You will need to create host file entries for these, in
order for the tests to pass.

Edit your `/etc/hosts` file, and append:

```
# Used for unit testing solid
127.0.0.1 nic.localhost
127.0.0.1 tim.localhost
127.0.0.1 nicola.localhost
```
